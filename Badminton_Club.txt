Badminton club:
Create an application for a Badminton club - sports centre. This club has 5 badminton courts where anyone can come in, play and pay. 
There is an administrator who looks after this club. He makes note of the players details, start and end time of matches played, the amount each player has to pay. 2 players are allowed to play a match in a court at any point of time. The player who loses the match will pay the price for the time played at the cost of  Rs. 2 per minute. Players (if they lose a match) can do a part payment on that day and the balance amount will be maintained. 

This application must be developed using spring-boot, spring-data JPA, spring security, my-sql database.

1. Admin must be able to login to the application using his/her username and password. Administrator has the role "admin-role". Implement spring-security with in-memory-authentication.

This amount must be added to the account_balance of loser's player_details.
